fix: integrate shared UI footer and fix PowerShell script issues

‚úÖ Fixes Applied:
- Fixed .npmrc with proper ${NPM_TOKEN} placeholder syntax
- Added SiteFooter component in layout.tsx with correct positioning
- Removed duplicate footer from page.tsx to avoid conflicts
- Created temporary mock SiteFooter until NPM_TOKEN is configured

‚úÖ Integration Status:
- PowerShell script structure worked correctly
- SiteFooter component created and imported
- Footer injection in layout.tsx successful
- Build passes with 6 pages

‚ö†Ô∏è Next Steps:
- Set NPM_TOKEN environment variable
- Replace mock footer with actual @drgblack/shared-ui import
- npm install @drgblack/shared-ui@latest will work once token is set
